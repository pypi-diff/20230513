-Description: # Overview
-        
-        This is a Python 3 implementation of a (3x3) Rubik's Cube solver.
-        
-        It contains:
-        
-        - A simple implementation of the cube
-        - A solver that follows a fixed algorithm
-        - An unintelligent solution sequence optimizer
-        - A decent set of test cases
-        
-        ## Installation
-        
-        The package is hosted on PyPI.
-        
-        ```
-        pip install rubik-cube
-        ```
-        
-        Import from the `rubik` package,
-        
-        ```python
-        >>> from rubik.cube import Cube
-        >>> c = Cube("OOOOOOOOOYYYWWWGGGBBBYYYWWWGGGBBBYYYWWWGGGBBBRRRRRRRRR")

-            RRR
-            RRR
-            RRR
-        ```
-        
-        ## Implementation
-        
-        ### Piece
-        
-        The cornerstone of this implementation is the Piece class. A Piece stores two
-        pieces of information:
-        
-        1. An integer `position` vector `(x, y, z)` where each component is in {-1, 0,
-        1}:
-            - `(0, 0, 0)` is the center of the cube
-            - the positive x-axis points to the right face
-            - the positive y-axis points to the up face
-            - the positive z-axis points to the front face
-        
-        2. A `colors` vector `(cx, cy, cz)`, giving the color of the sticker along each
-        axis. Null values are place whenever that Piece has less than three sides. For
-        example, a Piece with `colors=('Orange', None, 'Red')` is an edge piece with an
-        `'Orange'` sticker facing the x-direction and a `'Red'` sticker facing the
-        z-direction. The Piece doesn't know or care which direction along the x-axis
-        the `'Orange'` sticker is facing, just that it is facing in the x-direction and
-        not the y- or z- directions.
-        
-        Using the combination of `position` and `color` vectors makes it easy to
-        identify any Piece by its absolute position or by its unique combination of
-        colors.
-        
-        A Piece provides a method `Piece.rotate(matrix)`, which accepts a (90 degree)
-        rotation matrix. A matrix-vector multiplication is done to update the Piece's
-        `position` vector. Then we update the `colors` vector, by swapping exactly two
-        entries in the `colors` vector:
-        
-        - For example, a corner Piece has three stickers of different colors. After a
-          90 degree rotation of the Piece, one sticker remains facing down the same
-          axis, while the other two stickers swap axes. This corresponds to swapping the
-          positions of two entries in the Pieceâ€™s `colors` vector.
-        - For an edge or face piece, the argument is the same as above, although we may
-          swap around one or more null entries.
-        
-        ### Cube
-        
-        The Cube class is built on top of the Piece class. The Cube stores a list of
-        Pieces and provides nice methods for flipping slices of the cube, as well as
-        methods for querying the current state. (I followed standard [Rubik's Cube
-        notation](http://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/))
-        
-        Because the Piece class encapsulates all of the rotation logic, implementing
-        rotations in the Cube class is dead simple - just apply the appropriate
-        rotation matrix to all Pieces involved in the rotation. An example: To
-        implement `Cube.L()` - a clockwise rotation of the left face - do the
-        following:
-        
-        1. Construct the appropriate [rotation matrix](
-        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) for a 90 degree rotation in the
-        `x = -1` plane.
-        2. Select all Pieces satisfying `position.x == -1`.
-        3. Apply the rotation matrix to each of these Pieces.
-        
-        To implement `Cube.X()` - a clockwise rotation of the entire cube around the
-        positive x-axis - just apply a rotation matrix to all Pieces stored in the
-        Cube.
-        
-        ### Solver
-        
-        The solver implements the algorithm described
-        [here](http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/rubikscubesolution.html) and
-        [here](http://www.chessandpoker.com/rubiks-cube-solution.html). It is a
-        layer-by-layer solution. First the front-face (the `z = 1` plane) is solved,
-        then the middle layer (`z = 0`), and finally the back layer (`z = -1`). When
-        the solver is done, `Solver.moves` is a list representing the solution
-        sequence.
-        
-        My first correct-looking implementation of the solver average 252.5 moves per
-        solution sequence on 135000 randomly-generated cubes (with no failures).
-        Implementing a dumb optimizer reduced the average number of moves to 192.7 on
-        67000 randomly-generated cubes. The optimizer does the following:
-        
-        1. Eliminate full-cube rotations by "unrotating" the moves (Z U L D Zi becomes
-        L D R)
-        2. Eliminate moves followed by their inverse (R R Ri Ri is gone)
-        3. Replace moves repeated three times with a single turn in the opposite
-        direction (R R R becomes Ri)
-        
-        The solver is not particularly fast. On my machine (a 4.0 Ghz i7), it takes
-        about 0.06 seconds per solve on CPython, which is roughly 16.7 solves/second.
-        On PyPy, this is reduced to about 0.013 seconds per solve, or about 76
-        solves/second.

-        ## Implementation
-        
-        ### Piece
-        
-        The cornerstone of this implementation is the Piece class. A Piece stores two
-        pieces of information:
-        
-        1. An integer `position` vector `(x, y, z)` where each component is in {-1, 0,
-        1}:
-            - `(0, 0, 0)` is the center of the cube
-            - the positive x-axis points to the right face
-            - the positive y-axis points to the up face
-            - the positive z-axis points to the front face
-        
-        2. A `colors` vector `(cx, cy, cz)`, giving the color of the sticker along each
-        axis. Null values are place whenever that Piece has less than three sides. For
-        example, a Piece with `colors=('Orange', None, 'Red')` is an edge piece with an
-        `'Orange'` sticker facing the x-direction and a `'Red'` sticker facing the
-        z-direction. The Piece doesn't know or care which direction along the x-axis
-        the `'Orange'` sticker is facing, just that it is facing in the x-direction and
-        not the y- or z- directions.
-        
-        Using the combination of `position` and `color` vectors makes it easy to
-        identify any Piece by its absolute position or by its unique combination of
-        colors.
-        
-        A Piece provides a method `Piece.rotate(matrix)`, which accepts a (90 degree)
-        rotation matrix. A matrix-vector multiplication is done to update the Piece's
-        `position` vector. Then we update the `colors` vector, by swapping exactly two
-        entries in the `colors` vector:
-        
-        - For example, a corner Piece has three stickers of different colors. After a
-          90 degree rotation of the Piece, one sticker remains facing down the same
-          axis, while the other two stickers swap axes. This corresponds to swapping the
-          positions of two entries in the Pieceâ€™s `colors` vector.
-        - For an edge or face piece, the argument is the same as above, although we may
-          swap around one or more null entries.
-        
-        ### Cube
-        
-        The Cube class is built on top of the Piece class. The Cube stores a list of
-        Pieces and provides nice methods for flipping slices of the cube, as well as
-        methods for querying the current state. (I followed standard [Rubik's Cube
-        notation](http://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/))
-        
-        Because the Piece class encapsulates all of the rotation logic, implementing
-        rotations in the Cube class is dead simple - just apply the appropriate
-        rotation matrix to all Pieces involved in the rotation. An example: To
-        implement `Cube.L()` - a clockwise rotation of the left face - do the
-        following:
-        
-        1. Construct the appropriate [rotation matrix](
-        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) for a 90 degree rotation in the
-        `x = -1` plane.
-        2. Select all Pieces satisfying `position.x == -1`.
-        3. Apply the rotation matrix to each of these Pieces.
-        
-        To implement `Cube.X()` - a clockwise rotation of the entire cube around the
-        positive x-axis - just apply a rotation matrix to all Pieces stored in the
-        Cube.
-        
-        ### Solver
-        
-        The solver implements the algorithm described
-        [here](http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/rubikscubesolution.html) and
-        [here](http://www.chessandpoker.com/rubiks-cube-solution.html). It is a
-        layer-by-layer solution. First the front-face (the `z = 1` plane) is solved,
-        then the middle layer (`z = 0`), and finally the back layer (`z = -1`). When
-        the solver is done, `Solver.moves` is a list representing the solution
-        sequence.
-        
-        My first correct-looking implementation of the solver average 252.5 moves per
-        solution sequence on 135000 randomly-generated cubes (with no failures).
-        Implementing a dumb optimizer reduced the average number of moves to 192.7 on
-        67000 randomly-generated cubes. The optimizer does the following:
-        
-        1. Eliminate full-cube rotations by "unrotating" the moves (Z U L D Zi becomes
-        L D R)
-        2. Eliminate moves followed by their inverse (R R Ri Ri is gone)
-        3. Replace moves repeated three times with a single turn in the opposite
-        direction (R R R becomes Ri)
-        
-        The solver is not particularly fast. On my machine (a 4.0 Ghz i7), it takes
-        about 0.06 seconds per solve on CPython, which is roughly 16.7 solves/second.
-        On PyPy, this is reduced to about 0.013 seconds per solve, or about 76
-        solves/second.
